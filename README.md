### fruit-tictactoe

The fruit tic tac toe is an analogy of a classic tic tac toe game, but instead X's and O's the game is played with pineapples and peaches pictures. This new look makes the game more juicy and desirable to play.

In this game were used HTML5, CSS and given behavior in JavaScript.

the winning conditions were defined as array [
        [0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8],
        [0, 3, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 8],
        [0, 4, 8],
        [2, 4, 6]
    ];
each number represents the winning cell. Only three parallel cells in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction will define a winner who placed the fruit in the winning cells in specified direction.
